			<h2><span class="headingstyle2">  Recurve Bows </span></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>
			Recurve Bows are used by bigginers or pros alike. We carry many different sizes, 
			,poundages, and colors. Like previously stated, this is a good bow for someone who
			is just begining archery, and recomended because of its simplicity, cost, and poundage range. 
			</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<h2><span class="headingstyle2">  Long Bows </span></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>
			Long bows are another good choice for beginners, although pros use them as well. 
			like the recurve bow, they are simple and have a wide poundage range. However, keep in mind 
			the higher the poundage the bow the longer it gets. 
			</p>

			<h2><span class="headingstyle2"> Fantasy Bows </span></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>
			Our fantasy bows are our most custom type of bow that we have available. We will make
			any kind of bow from video games to movies as long as its feasible and safe. We have a 
			base charge of $450, and we add more depending on availabily of materials and intricasy of the design.

			<br/>
			<h2><span class="headingstyle2"> Compound Bows </span></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>
			Compound Bows are great for the bow hunter, the compitition shooter, or the beginners.
			We recomend that beginners use arm gaurds due to the high poundage most of our compound
			bows have. Compounds have a plethera of different types of sights, silencers, balancers, etc.
			that can be attacted.

			<br/>
			<p>
			Crossbows are perffect for thoughs who want the ease of using a gun, but they don't want to invest<br/>
			in bullets. Crossbows are good for hunting, bow fishing, and even compititions. <br/>
