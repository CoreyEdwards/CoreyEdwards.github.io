			<p>
			Recurve Bows are used by bigginers or pros alike. We carry many different sizes, <br/>
			,poundages, and colors. Like previously stated, this is a good bow for someone who<br/>
			is just begining archery, and recomended because of its simplicity, cost, and poundage range. <br/>
			</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<p>
			Long bows are another good choice for beginners, although pros use them as well. <br/>
			like the recurve bow, they are simple and have a wide poundage range. However, keep in mind <br/>
			the higher the poundage the bow the longer it gets. <br/>
			</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<p>
			Our fantasy bows are our most custom type of bow that we have available. We will make<br/>
			any kind of bow from video games to movies as long as its feasible and safe. We have a <br/>
			base charge of $450, and we add more depending on availabily of materials and intricasy of the design. <br/>
			</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<p>
			Compound Bows are great for the bow hunter, the compitition shooter, or the beginners.<br/>
			We recomend that beginners use arm gaurds due to the high poundage most of our compound<br/>
			bows have. Compounds have a plethera of different types of sights, silencers, balancers, etc.<br/>
			that can be attacted. 
			</p>

			<br/>
			<p>
			Crossbows are perffect for thoughs who want the ease of using a gun, but they don't want to invest<br/>
			in bullets. Crossbows are good for hunting, bow fishing, and even compititions. <br/>
