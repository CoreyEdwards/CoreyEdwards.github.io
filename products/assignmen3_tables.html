			<p>
			An arm gaurd is the perfect tool if you are just starting out with Archery.<br/>
			It helps to prevent the bow string from striking your arm and causing enjury.<br/>
			Even the most skilled archers use arm gaurds when shooting multiple rounds.<br/>
			</p>

			<br/>
			<p>
			Finger gaurds are perfect for when you are shooting multiple rounds.<br/>
			It helps to protect your fingers from getting soar or raw from the constant rubbing <br/>
			of the bow string. Beginners and professionals alike use them, so don't let your fingers get raw. <br/>
			</p>
			<br/>
		<img src="quiver.jpg" alt ="Quiver"/>
			<br/>
			<p>
			Quivers come in many different varieties but the function is the same. They hold <br/>
			the arrows so you dont have to. It is important to any archer to have a good quiver on his <br/>
			(or her) side or back. <br/>
			</p>
			<br/>
		<img src="release.jpg" alt ="Release"/>
			<br/>
			<p>
			A release assist ,or more commonly known as simply release, is used inplace of the finger gaurd. <br/>
			The release protects your fingers and helps to have a steady aim. Simply clip it on the string, pull <br/>
			it back, and fire away. <br/>
			</p>
			<br/>
		<img src="silencer.jpg" alt ="Silencer"/>
			<br/>
			<p>
			Silencers are most commonly used for the bow hunters or people who dont like that loud *twang* sound.<br/>
			They attach easily to either end of the bow and reduce the sound of the string when released. <br/>
